    "The wake from one wind turbine makes the turbines behind it less efficient. This effect is similar to the way that a speedboat is slowed by the choppy water caused by the boat in front. Wake steering is the intentional yaw misalignment of the leading turbines (i.e., pointing turbines slightly awy from oncoming wind) to deflect the energy deficit wake region away from downwind generators. Through wake steering, turbines in the front produce less power but downwind turbines can generate significantly more power.\n",

    "Wind farm operators traditionally face their turbines directly into the wind. New research shows that angling turbines slightly away from the wind steers their wakes away from downstream turbines and improves wind farm production. (Image credit: Rebecca Konte)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wake steering has emerged in the last decade as a promising collective control strategy to increase wind farm power production. [Research from Stanford University](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903680116) [1] suggests that fine-tuning the alignment of turbine arrays can reduce turbulence and increase production by up to 47%, especially at low speeds. At average wind speeds, the gain can still be an impressive 7-13%. Other benefits include reducing overall intermitency and mechanical degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing yaw control algorithms attempt to optimize yaw misalignment angle set-points using steady-state wake models. Wake models are susceptible to modeling error from inadequate modeling assumptions and error in model parameteres. Moreover, even if model parameters are set properly, they are prone to change due to machine degradation and static yaw misaslignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can provide an alternative to steady-state wake models. If the operational space of the wind turbines is mapped (i.e., data is collected at various combinations of yaw angles), a data scientist can use low-pass filtered data from the SCADA (e.g., 10 min averages) to build a machine learning model of power generation in the wind farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the steps of processing SCADA data to **build a machine learning model of power generation** in the wind farm, and will show how the model can be used to find **optimal yaw misalignment angles for varying wind conditions**."

    "A four-turbine wind farm was simulated with NREL's [Floris model](https://www.nrel.gov/wind/floris.html). The wind farm consists of 2 leading turbines and 2 trailing turbines. When wind comes with a direction of 270 degrees, the wake from the leading turbines impacts the performance of the trailing turbines. However, once the yaw angle is misaligned, the wake from the leading turbines does not directly impact the trailing turbines anymore, and overall generated power increases by 7.4%.\n",
